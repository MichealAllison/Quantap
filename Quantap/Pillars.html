                        Nano materials synthesis and characterization pillar focused 
                        on the synthesis and generation of new hybrid nanomaterials 
                        and nanocomposites with enhanced performance and tailorable 
                        properties which has found applications in many areas of research 
                        including environmental protection, biomedicine, sensing, catalysis, 
                        or multifunctional protective coatings. Apart from traditional synthetic 
                        processes, like the sol–gel method, there are nowadays a plethora of other 
                        more novel and advantageous bottom-up approaches that lead to the formation 
                        of hybrid nanomaterials. The precise characterization of their structural, 
                        morphological, and physicochemical features, as well as of their surface 
                        chemistry, is of paramount importance, since the properties to performance 
                        and cost correlation determine the possible practical applications in abovementioned 
                        areas. Organically modified silicates (ORMOSILS), metal–organic frameworks (MOF), or 
                        periodic mesoporous organosilicas (PMO) can be assumed among the most characteristic 
                        examples of hybrid nanomaterials of great scientific interest. The wide range of potential 
                        applications of hybrid nanomaterials in many well-established and emerging fields has 
                        intensified the research effort to achieve highly controlled synthesis in order to meet 
                        the required demands.

                            The Nanofabrication and nanomedicine pillar is a multidisciplinary team focusing on 
                            making nanoscale objects with special properties (e.g., quantum dot synthesis); assembling 
                            nanoscale objects into more complex structures (e.g., DNA origami-directed assembly);incorporating 
                            nanoscale objects into larger objects to enable special functionality (e.g., graphene into electronic
                            or sensor devices); and using nanotechnology to manufacture nanoscale structures (e.g., dip-pen 
                            nanolithography).In addition, develop nanomedicine products including physicochemical characterization, 
                            biocompatibility, and nanotoxicology evaluation, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics assessment, process 
                            control, and scale-reproducibility The characterization of a nanomedicine is necessary to understand its behavior 
                            in the human body, and to provide guidance for the process control and safety assessment. This characterization 
                            is not consensual in the number of parameters required for a correct and complete characterization.
